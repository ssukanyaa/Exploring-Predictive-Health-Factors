# 🧬 PCOS Prediction – Exploring Predictive Health Factors

This project aims to predict the presence of **Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)** based on patient health data using classification algorithms.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/exploring-predictive-health-factors/data)
- Features include: Age, Weight, Hyperandrogenism, Insulin_Resistance, Hormonal_Imbalance, Hirsutism, Exercise_Frequency, Sleep Hours.

## 🧠 Objective
To build a model to classify whether a patient has PCOS based on clinical indicators.

## 🔍 Workflow
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning & missing value treatment
- Feature engineering
- Model training:
  - XG Boost
  - Gradient Boost
  - Voting
- Evaluation metrics: ROC-AUC

## 🏆 Results
- Best ROC-AUC: `~80%` in private testset.
